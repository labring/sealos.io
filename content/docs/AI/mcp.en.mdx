## What is Model Context Protocol (MCP)?

The [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) (MCP) is a game-changing standard that lets AI models talk to external tools and data sources seamlessly. Instead of building custom integrations for every service, developers can integrate once and connect to any MCP-compatible system.

### The Problem MCP Solves

Here's the challenge: AI models are smart, but they're isolated. They can't access your databases, check your billing, or run code in your development environment. To make AI truly useful, you need to connect it to real-world systems.

The traditional approach? Build custom integrations for every single service. Each one has different APIs, authentication methods, and data formats. It's a maintenance nightmare that gets worse as you add more tools.

### MCP Changes Everything

MCP is like having a universal translator for AI integrations. Here's how it works:

**For Developers**: Write one MCP integration and connect to any MCP-compatible service. No more custom connectors for every tool.

**For Service Providers**: Build one MCP interface and instantly work with any MCP-enabled AI application.

**Think USB-C for AI**: Just like USB-C replaced dozens of different charging cables, MCP replaces dozens of different API integrations with one standard protocol.

### How MCP Works: The Three-Part System

MCP uses a simple client-server model with three key components:

- **MCP Host**: Your AI application (like Cursor, VS Code, or ChatGPT)
- **MCP Client**: The connection bridge that your AI app creates
- **MCP Server**: The external service that provides tools and data (like Sealos)

**Simple Example**: Your Cursor editor (Host) creates a connection (Client) to talk to Sealos services (Server). Want to connect to multiple services? Your editor just opens multiple connections.

## Sealos MCP: Your Cloud Platform, AI-Ready

Sealos has built MCP servers for all its major platform capabilities. Using StreamableHttp communication, these servers work seamlessly with any MCP-compatible IDE or AI application.

**Bottom line**: You can now control your entire Sealos infrastructure through natural language conversations with AI.

### What You Can Do with Sealos MCP

Here's what's available right now:

- **üõ†Ô∏è DevBox**: Spin up development environments and run code
- **üóÑÔ∏è Database**: Query and manage your databases
- **üí∞ Cost Center**: Check billing and manage expenses
- **üìä Observability**: Monitor performance and view logs

**Note**: Service availability varies by region. Check your Sealos console to see what's available in your zone.

### Quick Authentication Setup

Sealos uses your KubeConfig for authentication. Here's the simple 3-step process:

**Step 1: Get Your KubeConfig**
1. Go to [Sealos Console](https://os.sealos.io)
2. Click your profile picture (top right)
3. Select "KubeConfig" and copy the content

**Step 2: URL Encode It**

Choose any of these methods to URL-encode your KubeConfig:

**Method 1: Online Tool (Easiest)**
1. Open [URL Encoder](https://www.urlencoder.org/) or search "URL encoder"
2. Paste your KubeConfig content
3. Click "Encode"
4. Copy the encoded result

**Method 2: Browser Console**
1. Press `F12` on any webpage to open developer tools
2. Go to "Console" tab
3. Type this and press Enter:
   ```javascript
   encodeURIComponent(`paste your KubeConfig here`)
   ```
4. Copy the encoded output

**Method 3: Python (if installed)**
1. Open terminal
2. Type `python3` to enter Python
3. Run this code:
   ```python
   import urllib.parse
   kubeconfig = """paste your KubeConfig here"""
   encoded = urllib.parse.quote(kubeconfig)
   print(encoded)
   ```
4. Copy the encoded result

**Step 3: Use It**
Add this header to your MCP configuration:
```
Authorization: <your-url-encoded-kubeconfig>
```

**Example**: `apiVersion: v1` becomes `apiVersion%3A%20v1`

**Pro Tip**: Save your encoded KubeConfig somewhere safe‚Äîyou'll use it for all MCP configurations.

- Set appropriate `timeout` values for long-running operations

## When Things Don't Work

### "Connection Failed" - Fix It Fast

**Most Common Cause**: Wrong URL or bad auth token

**Quick Fixes:**
1. **Double-check your MCP service URL** - Copy it fresh from Sealos console
2. **Re-encode your KubeConfig** - Authentication tokens can get corrupted
3. **Test your network** - Can you reach sealos.run in your browser?
4. **Check the obvious** - Typos in configuration happen to everyone

### "Authentication Error" - Get Back In

**What Happened**: Your KubeConfig is invalid or expired

**Fix It:**
1. **Get a fresh KubeConfig** from Sealos console
2. **Make sure you copied the whole thing** - Missing characters break everything
3. **Re-encode it properly** - Use a reliable URL encoder
4. **Check your header format** - Should be `Authorization: <encoded-config>`

### "Tool Calls Failing" - Restore Functionality

**Likely Issues**: Permissions or service availability

**Solutions:**
1. **Verify your account permissions** - Do you have access to the service you're calling?
2. **Check service status** - Is the service running in your region?
3. **Look at error messages** - They usually tell you exactly what's wrong
4. **Try a simple test** - Start with basic operations before complex ones

### Pro Debugging Tips

- **Check connection status first** - Your IDE shows if MCP is connected
- **Enable verbose logging** - More info = faster fixes
- **Test one thing at a time** - Don't change multiple settings simultaneously
- **When in doubt, restart** - Sometimes IDEs need a fresh start after configuration changes
