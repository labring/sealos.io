# What Is Cloud Computing?

In today's digital-first world, "cloud computing" has become fundamental to how businesses operate and scale. Nowadays, cloud computing is adopted by every company, whether it is an MNC or a startup—many are still migrating towards it because of the cost-cutting, lesser maintenance, and the increased capacity of the data with the help of servers maintained by the cloud providers.

But what exactly is cloud computing, and how can it transform your organization? This comprehensive guide explores cloud computing fundamentals, service models, and deployment strategies that platforms like [Sealos](https://sealos.io) help organizations leverage effectively.

## How Cloud Computing Works

Cloud computing helps users easily access computing resources like storage and processing over the internet rather than local hardware. Here's how it works in a nutshell:

**Infrastructure**: Cloud computing depends on remote network servers hosted on the internet to store, manage, and process data.

**On-Demand Access**: Users can access cloud services and resources on-demand—they can scale up or down without having to invest in physical hardware.

**Service Delivery**: Cloud computing offers various benefits such as cost savings, scalability, reliability, and accessibility. It reduces capital expenditures and improves efficiency.

## Cloud Computing Defined: The Foundation of Modern IT

Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of computing services—including physical or virtual servers, data storage, networking capabilities, application development tools, software, AI-powered analytic platforms, and more—over the internet with pay-per-use pricing. Instead of owning and maintaining physical data centers and servers, organizations can access technology services on an as-needed basis from cloud providers.

Cloud computing means storing and accessing data and programs on remote servers that are hosted on the internet instead of the computer's hard drive or local server. Cloud computing is also referred to as Internet-based computing—it is a technology where resources are provided as a service through the Internet to the user. The data that is stored can be files, images, documents, or any other storable document.

### Understanding the Cloud Computing Model

At its essence, cloud computing is a **service delivery model** that enables organizations to access computing resources without the traditional burdens of ownership and management. Rather than purchasing, installing, and maintaining physical infrastructure, businesses can leverage shared computing resources provided by specialized cloud service providers.

The "cloud" doesn't refer to something floating in the sky. Instead, when you use cloud services, you're accessing remote servers—powerful mainframe computers housed in large data centers—through the internet. The cloud computing model gives you, the customer, greater flexibility and scalability compared to traditional on-premises infrastructure.

### The Shared Responsibility Model

One of the fundamental concepts in cloud computing is the **shared responsibility model**, which clearly defines what the cloud provider manages versus what the customer is responsible for:

**Cloud Provider Responsibilities:**

- Physical infrastructure (data centers, servers, networking hardware)
- Virtualization layer and hypervisors
- Host operating systems and patches
- Network controls and physical security
- Power, cooling, and environmental controls

**Customer Responsibilities:**

- Data classification and protection
- Identity and access management
- Application-level controls
- Operating system updates (in some models)
- Network traffic protection
- Firewall configuration

This division of responsibilities varies depending on the service model (IaaS, PaaS, or SaaS), but the core principle remains: cloud providers handle the underlying infrastructure complexity while customers focus on their applications and data.

Cloud computing is pivotal in our everyday lives, whether that means accessing a cloud application such as Google Gmail, streaming a movie on Netflix, or playing a cloud-hosted video game. With cloud computing, you get the computing power or storage you need, without having to own or manage the physical hardware yourself.

The [National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)](https://www.nist.gov/) defines cloud computing as "a model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction."

### Core Principles of Cloud Computing

At its core, cloud computing represents a shift from traditional IT models where organizations purchase, install, and maintain their own hardware and software. Instead, cloud computing provides:

- **On-demand self-service**: Users can provision computing capabilities automatically without requiring human interaction with service providers
- **Broad network access**: Services are available over the network through standard mechanisms
- **Resource pooling**: Computing resources are pooled to serve multiple consumers using a multi-tenant model
- **Rapid elasticity**: Capabilities can be elastically provisioned and released to scale rapidly
- **Measured service**: Cloud systems automatically control and optimize resource use by leveraging metering capabilities

Cloud computing isn't just about technology—it's about transforming how businesses operate, innovate, and compete in the digital economy. A cloud services provider (CSP) manages cloud-based technology services hosted at a remote data center and typically makes these resources available for a pay-as-you-go or monthly subscription fee.

## The Origins of Cloud Computing

Mainframe computing in the 1950s and the internet explosion in the 1990s came together to give rise to cloud computing. The origins of cloud computing technology go back to the early 1960s when Dr. Joseph Carl Robnett Licklider, an American computer scientist and psychologist known as the "father of cloud computing," introduced the earliest ideas of global networking in a series of memos discussing an Intergalactic Computer Network.

However, it wasn't until the early 2000s that modern cloud infrastructure for business emerged. Since businesses like Amazon, Google, and Salesforce started providing web-based services in the early 2000s, the term "cloud computing" has gained popularity. In 2002, Amazon Web Services started cloud-based storage and computing services. In 2006, it introduced Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2), an offering that allowed users to rent virtual computers to run their applications. That same year, Google introduced the Google Apps suite (now called Google Workspace), a collection of SaaS productivity applications.

In 2009, Microsoft started its first SaaS application, Microsoft Office 2011. By 2028, Gartner predicts cloud shifts from being an industry disruptor to becoming a business necessity and an integral part of business operations.

Scalability, adaptability, and cost-effectiveness are facilitated by the concept's on-demand internet-based access to computational resources. These days, cloud computing is common, driving a wide range of services across markets and transforming how data is processed, stored, and retrieved.

## What is Virtualization in Cloud Computing?

Virtualization is the software technology that helps provide logical isolation of physical resources. Creating logical isolation of physical resources such as RAM, CPU, and Storage over the cloud is known as Virtualization in Cloud Computing. Simply put, we can say it's creating virtual instances of computing resources over the cloud.

It provides better management and utilization of hardware resources with logical isolation, making applications independent of others. It facilitates streamlining resource allocation and enhancing scalability for multiple virtual computers within a single physical source, offering cost-effectiveness and better optimization of resources.

## Architecture of Cloud Computing

Cloud computing architecture refers to the components and sub-components required for cloud computing. These components typically refer to:

- **Front end** (Fat client, Thin client)
- **Back-end platforms** (Servers, Storage)
- **Cloud-based delivery and a network** (Internet, Intranet, Intercloud)

### 1. Front End (User Interaction Enhancement)

The User Interface of Cloud Computing consists of 2 sections of clients. The Thin clients are the ones that use web browsers facilitating portable and lightweight accessibility, and others are known as Fat Clients that use many functionalities for offering a strong user experience.

### 2. Back-end Platforms (Cloud Computing Engine)

The core of cloud computing is made at back-end platforms with several servers for storage and processing computing. Management of application logic is handled through servers, and effective data handling is provided by storage. The combination of these platforms at the backend offers the processing power and capacity to manage and store data behind the cloud.

### 3. Cloud-Based Delivery and Network

On-demand access to computing resources is provided over the Internet, Intranet, and Intercloud. The Internet comes with global accessibility, the Intranet helps in internal communications of services within the organization, and the Intercloud enables interoperability across various cloud services. This dynamic network connectivity ensures an essential component of cloud computing architecture, guaranteeing easy access and data transfer.

## Cloud Computing Components

The following are a few of the most integral components of today's modern cloud architecture:

### Data Centers

CSPs own and operate remote data centers that house physical or bare metal servers, cloud storage systems and other physical hardware that create the underlying infrastructure and provide the physical foundation for cloud computing.

### Networking Capabilities

In cloud computing, high-speed networking connections are crucial. Typically, an internet connection known as a wide-area network (WAN) connects front-end users (client-side interface made visible through web-enabled devices) with back-end functions (data centers and cloud-based applications and services).

Other advanced cloud computing networking technologies, including load balancers, content delivery networks (CDNs) and software-defined networking (SDN), are also incorporated to help ensure data flows quickly, easily and securely between front-end users and back-end resources.

### Virtualization

Cloud computing relies heavily on the virtualization of IT infrastructure (servers, operating system software, networking) that's abstracted by using special software so that it can be pooled and divided irrespective of physical hardware boundaries.

For example, a single hardware server can be divided into multiple virtual servers. Virtualization enables cloud providers to make maximum use of their data center resources.

## Cloud Computing Service Models

Infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS), platform-as-a-service (PaaS), software-as-a-service (SaaS) and serverless computing are the most common "as-a-service" cloud platform models. Most developers at large-scale organizations use some combination of all four.

IaaS offers full control over IT infrastructure, allowing organizations to build and manage systems. PaaS builds on IaaS by providing a platform that simplifies the development and deployment of applications, handling the underlying infrastructure for you. SaaS, the most widely used cloud service, delivers ready-to-use software, removing the need for management. And serverless computing, built on IaaS and PaaS, lets you focus solely on writing code.

Cloud computing services are typically categorized into three main service models, often referred to as the "cloud computing stack":

| Service Model                   | Acronym | Description                                                                                                       | Examples                                               |
| ------------------------------- | ------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Infrastructure as a Service** | IaaS    | Provides virtualized computing resources over the internet, including servers, storage, and networking            | Amazon EC2, Google Compute Engine, Microsoft Azure VMs |
| **Platform as a Service**       | PaaS    | Offers a platform allowing customers to develop, run, and manage applications without dealing with infrastructure | Google App Engine, Microsoft Azure App Service, Heroku |
| **Software as a Service**       | SaaS    | Delivers software applications over the internet on a subscription basis                                          | Google Workspace, Microsoft 365, Salesforce, Dropbox   |

### Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)

Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) is a type of cloud computing that gives people access to IT tools like virtual computers, storage, and networks through the internet. You don't need to buy or manage physical hardware. Instead, you pay only for what you use.

Infrastructure as a service (IaaS) provides on-demand access to fundamental computing resources—physical and virtual servers, networking and storage—over the internet on a pay-as-you-go basis.

IaaS enables users to scale and shrink resources on an as-needed basis, reducing the need for high up-front capital expenditures or unnecessary on-premises or "owned" infrastructure and for overbuying resources to accommodate periodic spikes in usage.

Here are some key benefits of using IaaS:

- **Flexibility and Control**: IaaS provides virtualized computing resources such as VMs, storage, and networks, facilitating users with control over the operating system and applications
- **Reducing Hardware Expenses**: IaaS provides business cost savings with the elimination of physical infrastructure investments, making it cost-effective
- **Scalability of Resources**: The cloud provides scaling of hardware resources up or down as per demand, facilitating optimal performance with cost efficiency

According to a report from the Business Research Company, the IaaS market is predicted to grow rapidly in the next few years, growing to USD 212.34 billion in 2028 at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 14.2%.

### Platform as a Service (PaaS)

Platform as a Service (PaaS) is a cloud computing model where a third-party provider offers the software and hardware tools needed to develop, test, and run applications. This allows users to focus on building their applications without worrying about managing servers or infrastructure.

Platform as a service (PaaS) provides software developers with an on-demand platform—hardware, complete software stack, infrastructure and development tools—for running, developing and managing applications without the cost, complexity and inflexibility of maintaining that platform on-premises.

For example, AWS Elastic Beanstalk is a PaaS offered by Amazon Web Services that helps developers quickly deploy and manage applications while AWS takes care of the needed resources like servers, load balancing, and scaling.

With PaaS, the cloud provider hosts everything at their data center. These include servers, networks, storage, operating system software, middleware and databases. Developers simply pick from a menu to spin up servers and environments they need to run, build, test, deploy, maintain, update and scale applications.

Here are some key benefits of using PaaS:

- **Simplifying Development**: Platform as a Service offers application development by keeping the underlying Infrastructure as an abstraction. It helps developers completely focus on application logic (code) while background operations are completely managed by the platform
- **Enhancing Efficiency and Productivity**: PaaS lowers the management of infrastructure complexity, speeding up execution time and bringing updates quickly to market by streamlining the development process
- **Automation of Scaling**: Management of resource scaling, guaranteeing the program's workload efficiency is ensured by PaaS

Today, PaaS is typically built around containers, a virtualized compute model one step removed from virtual servers. Containers virtualize the operating system, enabling developers to package the application with only the operating system services it needs to run on any platform without modification and the need for middleware.

### Software as a Service (SaaS)

Software as a Service (SaaS) is a way of using software over the internet instead of installing it on your computer. The software is hosted by a company, and you can use it just by logging in through a web browser. You don't need to worry about updates, maintenance, or storage—the provider takes care of all that.

Software as a service (SaaS), also known as cloud-based software or cloud applications, is interactive application software hosted in the cloud. Users access SaaS through a web browser, a dedicated desktop client or an application programming interface (API) that integrates with a desktop or mobile operating system.

A common example is Google Docs. You can write and share documents online without downloading any software.

In addition to the cost savings, time-to-value and scalability benefits of the cloud, SaaS offers the following:

- **Collaboration and Accessibility**: Software as a Service (SaaS) helps users easily access applications without having the requirement of local installations. It is fully managed by the service provider, working over the internet and encouraging effortless cooperation and ease of access
- **Automatic upgrades**: With SaaS, users have access to new features when the cloud service provider adds them without having to orchestrate an on-premises upgrade. SaaS providers manage the handling of software maintenance with automatic latest updates, ensuring users gain experience with the latest features and security patches
- **Protection from data loss**: Because SaaS stores application data in the cloud with the application, users don't lose data if their device crashes or breaks
- **Cost Efficiency**: SaaS acts as a cost-effective solution by reducing the overhead of IT support by eliminating the need for individual software licenses

According to a study from Fortune Business Insights, the global software as a service (SaaS) market size was valued at USD 273.55 billion in 2023 and is projected to grow from USD 317.55 billion in 2024 to USD 1,228.87 billion by 2032.

### Serverless Computing (Function as a Service - FaaS)

Function as a service (FaaS) is a cloud-computing service that allows customers to run code in response to events, without managing the complex infrastructure. You just write the code, upload it, and the cloud provider runs it only when it's needed. You pay only for the time your code runs.

Serverless computing, or simply serverless, is a cloud computing model that offloads all the back-end infrastructure management tasks, including provisioning, scaling, scheduling and patching, to the cloud provider. This capability frees developers to focus all their time and effort on the code and business logic specific to their applications.

For example, with AWS Lambda, you can write a function that resizes images whenever someone uploads a photo to your website. You don't need to keep a server running all the time—AWS runs your function only when a photo is uploaded.

Moreover, serverless runs application code on a per-request basis only and automatically scales the supporting infrastructure up and down in response to the number of requests. With serverless, customers pay only for the resources used when the application runs; they never pay for idle capacity.

Here are some key benefits of using FaaS:

- **Event-Driven Execution**: FaaS helps in the maintenance of servers and infrastructure, making users not worry about it. FaaS facilitates developers to run code as a response to events
- **Cost Efficiency**: FaaS facilitates cost efficiency by coming up with the principle "Pay as per you Run" for the computing resources used
- **Scalability and Agility**: Serverless architectures scale effortlessly in handling workloads, promoting agility in development and deployment

Function as a service (FaaS) is often confused with serverless computing when, in fact, it's a subset of serverless. FaaS allows developers to run portions of application code (called functions) in response to specific events. Everything besides the code—physical hardware, virtual machine (VM), operating system and web server software management—is provisioned automatically by the cloud service provider in real-time as the code runs and is spun back down once the execution is complete.

### Additional Service Models

As cloud computing has evolved, additional service models have emerged:

- **Container as a Service (CaaS)**: Containerized application deployment and management. Platforms like [Sealos](https://sealos.io) provide Kubernetes-native container orchestration with simplified management interfaces.
- **Database as a Service (DBaaS)**: Managed database services without infrastructure management
- **Backend as a Service (BaaS)**: Pre-built backend services for mobile and web applications

## Cloud Computing Deployment Models

Organizations can choose from several deployment models based on their specific needs, security requirements, and budget constraints:

### Public Cloud

Public clouds are owned and operated by third-party cloud service providers who deliver computing resources over the internet. Multiple organizations share the same infrastructure, but their data and applications remain isolated and secure.

A public cloud is a type of cloud computing in which a cloud service provider makes computing resources available to users over the public internet. The public cloud provider owns, manages and assumes all responsibility for the data centers, hardware and infrastructure on which its customers' workloads run.

Most enterprises have moved portions of their computing infrastructure to the public cloud since public cloud services are elastic and readily scalable, flexibly adjusting to meet changing workload demands. The promise of greater efficiency and cost savings through paying only for what they use attracts customers to the public cloud.

**Key Benefits:**

- Shared infrastructure providing cost efficiency
- Pay-as-you-use pricing model
- High scalability and availability
- Minimal upfront investment
- Provider manages all infrastructure

**Examples:** Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform (GCP)

### Private Cloud

A private cloud is a cloud environment where all cloud infrastructure and computing resources are dedicated to one customer only. Private cloud combines many benefits of cloud computing—including elasticity, scalability and ease of service delivery—with the access control, security and resource customization of on-premises infrastructure.

Many companies choose a private cloud over a public cloud environment to meet regulatory compliance requirements. Large-scale entities such as government agencies, healthcare organizations and financial institutions often opt for private cloud settings for workloads that deal with confidential documents, personally identifiable information (PII), intellectual property, medical records, financial data or other sensitive data.

**Key Benefits:**

- Dedicated resources for a single organization
- Enhanced security and compliance control
- Customizable to specific business needs
- Complete control over infrastructure
- Predictable performance and costs

### Hybrid Cloud

A hybrid cloud is just what it sounds like: a combination of public cloud, private cloud and on-premises environments. Specifically (and ideally), a hybrid cloud connects a combination of these three environments into a single, flexible infrastructure for running the organization's applications and workloads.

At first, organizations turned to hybrid cloud computing models primarily to migrate portions of their on-premises data into private cloud infrastructure and then connect that infrastructure to public cloud infrastructure hosted off-premises by cloud vendors. This process was done through a packaged hybrid cloud solution or middleware and IT management tools to create a "single pane of glass." Teams and administrators rely on this unified dashboard to view their applications, networks and systems.

Today, hybrid cloud architecture has expanded beyond physical connectivity and cloud migration to offer a flexible, secure and cost-effective environment that supports the portability and automated deployment of workloads across multiple environments. This feature enables an organization to meet its technical and business objectives more effectively and cost-efficiently than with a public or private cloud alone.

For instance, a hybrid cloud environment is ideal for DevOps and other teams to develop and test web applications. This frees organizations from purchasing and expanding the on-premises physical hardware needed to run application testing, offering faster time to market. Once a team has developed an application in the public cloud, they can move it to a private cloud environment based on business needs or security factors.

A public cloud also allows companies to quickly scale resources in response to unplanned spikes in traffic without impacting private cloud workloads, a feature known as cloud bursting. Streaming channels such as Amazon use cloud bursting to support the increased viewership traffic when they start new shows.

Most enterprise organizations today rely on a hybrid cloud model because it offers greater flexibility, scalability and cost optimization than traditional on-premises infrastructure setups. According to the IBM Transformation Index: State of Cloud, more than 77% of businesses and IT professionals have adopted a hybrid cloud approach.

**Characteristics:**

- Combines benefits of both public and private clouds
- Enables workload portability between environments
- Supports compliance with data sovereignty requirements
- Allows for cost optimization strategies
- Requires integration and management complexity

For an in-depth exploration of hybrid cloud architecture, benefits, and implementation strategies, read our comprehensive guide: [What is Hybrid Cloud?](/blog/what-is-hybrid-cloud).

### Multi-Cloud

Multi-cloud uses two or more clouds from two or more different cloud providers. A multi-cloud environment can be as simple as email SaaS from one vendor and image editing SaaS from another. But when enterprises talk about multi-cloud, they typically use multiple cloud services—including SaaS, PaaS and IaaS—from two or more leading public cloud providers.

Organizations choose multi-cloud to avoid vendor lock-in, have more services to select from and access more innovation. With multi-cloud, organizations can choose and customize a unique set of cloud features and services to meet their business needs. This freedom of choice includes selecting "best-of-breed" technologies from any CSP (as needed or as they emerge), rather than being locked into offering from a single vendor.

For example, an organization can choose AWS for its global reach with web hosting, IBM Cloud for data analytics and machine learning (ML) platforms and Microsoft Azure for its security features.

A multi-cloud environment also reduces exposure to licensing, security and compatibility issues resulting from "shadow IT"—any software, hardware or IT resource used on an enterprise network without the IT department's approval and often without IT's knowledge or oversight.

### The Modern Hybrid Multi-Cloud

Today, most enterprise organizations use a hybrid multi-cloud model. Besides the flexibility to choose the most cost-effective cloud service, hybrid multi-cloud offers the most control over workload deployment, enabling organizations to operate more efficiently, improve performance and optimize costs.

According to an IBM Institute for Business Value study, the value derived from a full hybrid multi-cloud platform technology and operating model at scale is two-and-a-half times the value derived from a single-platform, single-cloud vendor approach.

Yet the modern hybrid multi-cloud model comes with more complexity. The more clouds that you use—each with its own management tools, data transmission rates and security protocols—the more difficult it can be to manage your environment. With over 97% of enterprises operating on more than one cloud and most organizations running 10 or more clouds, a hybrid cloud management approach has become crucial.

**Characteristics:**

- Services distributed across multiple cloud providers
- Reduces dependency on single vendor
- Enables selection of best services from each provider
- Increases complexity in management and integration
- Requires expertise across multiple platforms

## Key Characteristics of Cloud Computing

The NIST definition identifies five essential characteristics that define cloud computing:

### 1. On-Demand Self-Service

Users can provision computing capabilities automatically without requiring human interaction with service providers. This includes:

- **Automated resource provisioning**: Spin up servers, storage, or databases instantly
- **Self-service portals**: User-friendly interfaces for managing resources
- **API-driven management**: Programmatic access to cloud services
- **Instant scalability**: Resources available when needed without delays

### 2. Broad Network Access

Cloud services are available over the network through standard mechanisms, enabling access from various devices and locations:

- **Internet connectivity**: Access from anywhere with internet connection
- **Multiple device support**: Smartphones, tablets, laptops, and desktops
- **Standard protocols**: HTTP/HTTPS, REST APIs, and other web standards
- **Global accessibility**: Services available across geographic regions

### 3. Resource Pooling

Computing resources are pooled to serve multiple consumers using a multi-tenant model:

- **Shared infrastructure**: Efficient utilization of physical resources
- **Location independence**: Resources assigned dynamically based on demand
- **Multi-tenancy**: Secure isolation between different customers
- **Economies of scale**: Cost benefits from shared infrastructure

### 4. Rapid Elasticity

Resources can be elastically provisioned and released to scale rapidly:

- **Auto-scaling**: Automatic adjustment based on demand
- **Horizontal scaling**: Adding more instances of resources
- **Vertical scaling**: Increasing the capacity of existing resources
- **Pay-as-you-scale**: Costs adjust with resource usage

### 5. Measured Service

Cloud systems automatically control and optimize resource usage through metering capabilities:

- **Usage monitoring**: Real-time tracking of resource consumption
- **Billing transparency**: Detailed cost breakdowns by service
- **Performance metrics**: Monitoring of system performance and availability
- **Capacity planning**: Data-driven decisions for resource allocation

## Characteristics of Cloud Computing

The following are the key characteristics of Cloud Computing:

### 1. Scalability

With cloud hosting, it is easy to grow and shrink the number and size of servers based on need. This is done by either increasing or decreasing resources in the cloud. This ability to alter plans due to fluctuations in business size and needs is a superb benefit of cloud computing, especially when experiencing sudden growth in demand.

Resources can be elastically provisioned and released to scale rapidly:

- **Auto-scaling**: Automatic adjustment based on demand
- **Horizontal scaling**: Adding more instances of resources
- **Vertical scaling**: Increasing the capacity of existing resources
- **Pay-as-you-scale**: Costs adjust with resource usage

### 2. Cost Savings

An advantage of cloud computing is the reduction in hardware costs. Instead of purchasing in-house equipment, hardware needs are left to the vendor. For companies that are growing rapidly, new hardware can be large, expensive, and inconvenient. Cloud computing alleviates these issues because resources can be acquired quickly and easily.

Even better, the cost of repairing or replacing equipment is passed to the vendors. Along with purchase costs, off-site hardware cuts internal power costs and saves space. Large data centers can take up precious office space and produce a large amount of heat. Moving to cloud applications or storage can help maximize space and significantly cut energy expenditures.

### 3. Reliability

Rather than being hosted on one single instance of a physical server, hosting is delivered on a virtual partition that draws its resource, such as disk space, from an extensive network of underlying physical servers. If one server goes offline it will have no effect on availability, as the virtual servers will continue to pull resources from the remaining network of servers.

### 4. Physical Security

The underlying physical servers are still housed within data centers and so benefit from the security measures that those facilities implement to prevent people from accessing or disrupting them on-site.

### 5. Outsourced Management

When you are managing the business, someone else manages your computing infrastructure. You do not need to worry about management as well as degradation.
