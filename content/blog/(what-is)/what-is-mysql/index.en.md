**Tables** are the fundamental data storage structures organized in rows and columns, where each table represents an entity and columns define attributes.

Example table creation:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE ecommerce;
USE ecommerce;

CREATE TABLE customers (
    customer_id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    first_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    last_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

### Indexes and Keys

**Indexes** improve query performance by creating efficient access paths to data:

1. **Primary Key**: Unique identifier for each row
2. **Unique Index**: Ensures uniqueness across specified columns
3. **Composite Index**: Covers multiple columns for complex queries
4. **Full-Text Index**: Enables text search capabilities

**Foreign Keys** establish relationships between tables and enforce referential integrity.

### Views and Stored Procedures

**Views** provide virtual tables that simplify complex queries and enhance security by controlling data access.

**Stored Procedures** are pre-compiled SQL programs that encapsulate business logic and improve performance through reduced network traffic.

### Triggers and Events

**Triggers** automatically execute code in response to specific database events like INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE operations.

**Events** are scheduled tasks that run at specified times or intervals, useful for maintenance operations and data processing.
