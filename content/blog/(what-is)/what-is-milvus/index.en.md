# What Is Milvus?

Milvus is a powerful, open-source vector database specifically designed for AI applications and similarity search. Built to handle massive-scale vector data, Milvus provides high-performance storage, indexing, and querying capabilities for machine learning workloads, making it an essential component in modern AI infrastructure.

Named after the Milvus bird of prey known for its speed, keen vision, and remarkable adaptability, Milvus embodies these qualities in its database design. Interestingly, every Zilliz open-source project follows a bird naming convention, symbolizing freedom, foresight, and the agile evolution of technology.

## Understanding Unstructured Data and Embeddings

In the context of AI applications, Milvus excels at managing unstructured data through vector embeddings. Unstructured data—such as text, images, audio, and video—varies in format and carries rich underlying semantics, making it challenging to analyze using traditional database systems.

To bridge this gap, **embeddings** are used to convert unstructured data into numerical vectors that capture essential characteristics and semantic meaning. These high-dimensional vectors enable machines to understand and process unstructured content mathematically, opening the door to sophisticated AI applications like semantic search, recommendation systems, and content analysis.

Milvus serves as the specialized storage and retrieval engine for these vector embeddings, enabling fast and scalable similarity searches that power modern AI applications.

As vector databases become critical infrastructure for AI workloads, many organizations choose [managed database services](/products/databases) to handle the operational complexity of maintaining high-performance vector search capabilities at scale.

## The History and Evolution of Milvus

Milvus was created to address the growing need for efficient vector similarity search in AI and machine learning applications. As deep learning models began generating high-dimensional vector embeddings for images, text, audio, and other data types, traditional databases proved inadequate for handling similarity search at scale.
