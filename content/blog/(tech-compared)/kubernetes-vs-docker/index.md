## Introduction

In the world of containerization, Docker and Kubernetes serve as vital tools, each with their own roles. Docker is a platform for containerization, while Kubernetes orchestrates containers across clusters using various container runtimes including Docker, containerd, CRI-O, and Mirantis Container Runtime. While they serve different purposes, Docker and Kubernetes are often used together—Docker for building containers, and Kubernetes for managing them at scale.

This guide covers the fundamentals of both technologies, including their key features, advantages and disadvantages, use cases, and when to use each one. We'll also include a direct comparison and common FAQs.

## What Are Containers?

Think of containers like portable boxes for your apps: they include everything needed to run your app—code, runtime, libraries—ensuring it works the same on your laptop as it does in the cloud. This abstraction from the underlying infrastructure makes it easy to deploy container-based applications consistently across private data centers, public clouds, or local machines.

## What Is Docker?

Docker is a platform used to build, package, and distribute applications inside containers. These containers include everything needed to run an application—code, libraries, and system tools—ensuring consistency across environments. Want to learn more about Docker?

### Key Features of Docker

- Easy Configuration: Rapid setup and deployment across environments.
- Swarm Mode: Cluster management and orchestration.
- Security Management: Built-in secrets management.
- Service Management: Define and manage container state.
- Productivity Boost: Simplifies DevOps workflows.

### Docker Advantages

- Build once, run anywhere.
- Eliminates "it works on my machine" issues.
- Highly portable across environments.
- Built-in version control for containers.

### Docker Disadvantages

- Missing advanced features (e.g. self-registration).
- Data persistence can be tricky.
- Limited GUI support.
- Less benefit for monolithic applications.

### Use Cases of Docker

- Simplified development and testing.
- Microservices deployment.
- Seamless CI/CD integration.
- Consistent environment standardization.

## What Is Kubernetes?

Kubernetes is a container orchestration system originally developed by Google. It helps manage containerized applications across physical, virtual, and cloud infrastructures. Kubernetes supports scalability, self-healing, and declarative configuration. Want to learn more about Kubernetes? Check out [What Is Kubernetes?](https://sealos.io/blog/what-is-kubernetes).

### Key Features of Kubernetes

- Runs Anywhere: Open-source and infrastructure-agnostic.
- Automation: Automated container scheduling and scaling.
- Interactivity: Manages multiple clusters and enables both horizontal and vertical scaling.
- Service Extensions: Built-in support for networking, security, and storage.
- Self-Monitoring: Health checks for containers and nodes.

### Kubernetes Advantages

- Automatically schedules containers to optimize resource use.
- Facilitates service discovery and inter-container communication.
- Provides self-healing capabilities for container failures.
- Supports rolling updates for zero-downtime deployments.

### Kubernetes Disadvantages

- Steep learning curve.
- Manual installation and complex configuration.
- No default high-availability; must be set up manually.
- Potential compatibility issues during migrations.

### Use Cases of Kubernetes

- Microservices architecture.
- CI/CD pipeline orchestration.
- Hybrid and multi-cloud deployments.
- Dynamic resource optimization.

## Docker or Kubernetes: Which One Is Right for You?

Docker is best for simpler, smaller-scale deployments or for individual developers who want fast setup. It’s also ideal for CI/CD workflows where simplicity is key.

Kubernetes shines in enterprise-scale environments that demand high availability, scalability, and complex service management. Cloud providers like AWS, Azure, and GCP offer managed Kubernetes (EKS, AKS, GKE), making it easier to adopt at scale.

If you need both containerization and orchestration, Docker and Kubernetes often work together: Docker builds containers, Kubernetes orchestrates them.

## Using Kubernetes with Docker

Kubernetes can orchestrate containers built with Docker. Developers use Docker to create images, which Kubernetes then deploys, scales, and manages across clusters.

## Kubernetes vs Docker – FAQs

**Can Docker and Kubernetes be used together?**
Yes. Docker creates containers, and Kubernetes orchestrates them at scale.

**Is Kubernetes replacing Docker?**
Not exactly. Kubernetes deprecated Docker as a container runtime internally but supports alternatives like containerd, which Docker itself uses. Docker is still widely used for image creation.

**Is Docker easier to learn than Kubernetes?**
Yes. Docker has a more intuitive setup and developer experience. Kubernetes is more powerful but has a steeper learning curve.

**What if I just need a development environment?**
Use [DevBox](https://sealos.io/blog/what-is-devbox) in Sealos. It allows you to create and test containerized apps in a cloud-based environment with just one click—no Kubernetes setup required.
