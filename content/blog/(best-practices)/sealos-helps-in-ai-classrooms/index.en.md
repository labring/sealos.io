# How Sealos Helps in AI Classrooms and Research Projects

_From student competitions to university cloud labs — real-world Sealos use cases_

In recent years, cloud-native tools have become a staple in computer science education and applied research. Yet many educators and students still struggle with setting up environments, managing resources, or ensuring fairness and reproducibility in hands-on experiments.

Sealos offers a lightweight, zero-cloud-required solution designed to simplify infrastructure across education and research settings. From individual student projects to full-class cloud environments, it provides a production-grade foundation with minimal operational overhead.

----------

## A Free Plan That Works Beyond the Classroom

The Cursor Student Plan was introduced to help students get hands-on with real deployment — not limited by course enrollment, institution, or academic major. As long as you’re actively learning or building something technical, Sealos offers free MicroVMs, persistent storage, and access to deployment templates.

But students aren’t the only ones benefiting. Increasingly, instructors and research staff are using Sealos to manage experiments, host student environments, and simulate production-like conditions — all without relying on costly or fragile external cloud providers.

----------

## Inside a Real AI Competition: Sealos in Action

During a recent university-level AI development competition, over 40 teams were challenged to build real-time vision models under constrained resources. The organizers chose Sealos to host each team’s deployment environment, ensuring consistency across testing conditions.

On the second day of the event, a node crash was simulated to test system fault tolerance. While most students weren’t even aware of the failure, Sealos automatically rerouted services and recovered containers within seconds. Logs remained intact, inference APIs continued serving requests, and no team experienced data loss.

> _"We didn’t tell them we pulled a node offline until the closing ceremony. Nobody noticed. That’s the point."_ — Dr. L. Wang, competition lead and professor of applied AI

In addition to resiliency, the organizers noted how quickly teams could deploy updates. GitHub push-to-deploy workflows were enabled by default, allowing each team to iterate on models without manual intervention from IT staff.

## Teaching with Sealos: Controlled, Isolated, Reproducible

University educators are also using Sealos to provision lab environments for operating systems, networks, and AI infrastructure courses. Since each student can deploy their own copy of a project inside an isolated MicroVM, cheating becomes more difficult, and grading becomes more objective.

Instructors can:

-   Preload templates for coding or system-level tasks (e.g., sandboxed C environments, ML inference servers)
    
-   Set default environment variables or constraints (e.g., memory limits, timeouts)
    
-   Use auto-generated logs and deployment history for student evaluation
    
-   Maintain reproducibility across assignments by version-controlling the base template
    

For example, in a distributed systems course, students may be asked to build a multi-node chat app. With Sealos, they deploy once and test distributed behavior — without needing to install Docker, set up port forwarding, or debug inconsistent local environments.

> _“I used to spend half my office hours debugging student machines. Now they just deploy to Sealos — and focus on the system logic instead.”_ — A. Khoo, Lecturer, School of Computing

## How Sealos Simplifies Infrastructure Compared to Traditional Cloud

Educators often rely on AWS credits, shared university servers, or custom VM scripts. These methods work — but come with cost, complexity, and fragility.

#### Here’s how Sealos compares:
|Task|Traditional Setup (AWS/local)|Sealos Approach|
|----------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------|
|Environment provisioning|Manual EC2/VM setup, networking|One-click deploy from template|
|Student access control|IAM roles or shared credentials|GitHub login, workspace isolation|
|Project reproducibility|Image snapshots or scripts|Git-versioned templates + build logs|
|Crash recovery|Manual intervention|Auto self-healing with MicroVMs|
|Instructor grading|Screenshots or screen sharing|Logs, deployment history, runtime stats|
|Time investment (setup/debugging)|High|Low|

Sealos isn’t just cheaper — it removes layers of friction that interrupt learning and instruction.

## How a Class Might Use Sealos — A Visual Flow

To make the process clearer, here’s a simplified view of how instructors and students interact through Sealos:

CopyEdit

`[Instructor] ↓` 
`Designs template assignment (e.g., Flask + Redis)` `↓` 
`Pushes to GitHub or uploads via Console` `↓` 
`Shares template URL with students` `[Student]` `↓` 
`Logs in via GitHub` `↓` 
`Clones & deploys assignment in MicroVM` `↓` `Pushes changes via GitHub → Auto redeploy` `↓` 
`Runs and tests application` `[Instructor]` `↓` 
`Accesses deployment logs, timestamps, config history` `↓` 
`Evaluates logic, stability, and performance` `↓` 
`Exports logs or scores for grading`

This flow ensures students are evaluated on their actual deployment — not just code snippets — and instructors regain time lost to tech support.

## A Future-Proof Platform for Research Environments

For research teams, especially in AI and systems engineering, Sealos offers a cost-effective way to isolate experiments, automate training pipelines, and test fault tolerance under real deployment conditions. Because everything runs inside MicroVMs on a Kubernetes backbone, researchers can run GPU-heavy workloads, stateful services, and real-time inference models with production-like behavior — even before committing to a cloud provider.

And since Sealos supports GitHub-based versioning and declarative configuration, research artifacts remain reproducible and verifiable across environments.
